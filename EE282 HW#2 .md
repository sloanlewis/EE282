## _Question 1:_
First create a directory called _**Fun**_ and move into that directory. In this directory make 2 files called _**red**_ and _**blue**_. Check that you have made the correct files in _**Fun**_.


```
mkdir Fun
cd Fun
touch red blue
ls ./
```
Change the name of the file _**red**_ to _**orange**_ and delete the file _**blue**_. Now you should only have 1 file called _**orange**_ in _**Fun**_.

```
mv red orange
rm blue
```

## _Question 2:_

First generate _**mymatrix**_ to be a matrix with lowercase letters _a_ through _o_, 5 rows and 3 columns.

```
mymatrix <- matrix(data= letters[1:15], nrow=5, ncol=3)

```
How would you print the third column of this matrix using numeric indices and retaining the column format?

```
mymatrix[,3,drop=F]
```
Next generate _**mydf**_ from the code below:

```
require('RCurl')
mlbweightdfurl <- 'http://goo.gl/rih9v9'
mlb.weight.df <- textConnection(getURL(mlbweightdfurl, followlocation  = TRUE))
mlb.weight.df <- read.table(mlb.weight.df, header = TRUE)
mydf <- head(mlb.weight.df)
```
Show 2 ways you could print the third column of the data frame as a vector.

```
mydf[,3]
mydf[[3]]
```
Show 2 ways you could print the third column retaining the column format.

```
mydf[,3 ,drop=F]
mydf[3]
```
Will both of these ways work for a matrix as well?
	_No, if you subset the matrix the second way it will return the third entry only. In a data frame this allows you to access the third "list" that makes up the data frame._

### Question 3 Comments:

Well done. Thanks for noting that you  can choose to either set drop = F to get an array/matrix back.

## _Question 3:_
Use file _**orange**_ in directory _**Fun**_ created above in Question 1. Change the permissions so that someone in your group or outside of your group could read and write into the file _**orange**_. 

```
chmod go+rwx /Fun
chmod go+rw /orange
```
